My smart contract heavily used modifiers to ensure that functions would only be called when they were supposed to and expected to. That being said, there is a good chance that I missed certain cases, but overall I think the pattern is effective. Methods of avoiding certain attacks are mentioned in the `avoiding_common_attacks.md` file. 

The aforementioned modifiers often referred to boolean state variables created to keep track of state and whether or not certain operations were allowed. In terms of data structures, I used an array of fixed-size to keep track of owners of individual fantasy players, but otherwise used mappings (which generally run faster in terms of look-up and inserts, depending on the implementation) to associate accounts with certain values (such as balances).

I tried to isolate and compartmentalize my variables, modifiers, and functions as much as possible to promote modularity. I'm sure there could have been improvements made on the variables front, but I chose to use maps over arrays in some cases to specifically avoid the prospect of having to iterate through an array of potentially indeterminate size, which could lead to vulnerabilities.
